        <h3> What will we be discussing?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Baku
            <li>Azerbaijan
            <li> their history, architecture and how Azerbaijan came to be a tourist's top destination!
        </ul>
        <p>
            Baku, the capital and commercial hub of Azerbaijan, is a low-lying city with coastline along the Caspian Sea. It's famed for its medieval walled old city, which contains the Palace of the Shirvanshahs, a vast royal complex, and the iconic stone Maiden Tower. Contemporary landmarks include the Zaha Hadid–designed Heydar Aliyev Center, and the Flame Towers, 3 pointed skyscrapers covered with LED screens.<br><br>
            <br>Modern and Historical<br><br>
Baku’s historical core, or Icheri Sheher, has the ancient cylindrical Maiden Tower, the medieval Palace of Shirvanshahs and stalls selling traditional Azerbaijan carpets. Head further from the centre, and you’re walking along Nizami Street’s pedestrianised shopping district. Gothic and Baroque styles from the Russian Empire and Baku’s first oil boom, both in the late 19th-century, line the long and straight streets of Azerbaijan’s capital.
            
            <br><br>Music and Dance<br><br>
This is easy to find because local music and dance is performed at many of the city’s best local restaurants. Listen out for Mugham music, which is famous for its creativity and diversity. It is played on national musical instruments, and sounded strange to me at first, but I’m really getting to enjoy it.<br>
Take in a performance at the Azerbaijan State Philharmonic named after Muslim Maqomayev. This building is truly fantastic. Modelled on Monte Carlo’s casino, its pretty, creamy yellow and white exterior is offset by its splendid position overlooking a park just outside the ancient city walls. Performances here are always exceptional. Dress up in your finery and go and enjoy a good concert. Azerbaijani and Russian composers are celebrated with pride, but European composers are enjoyed too. The Azerbaijan State Symphony Orchestra, Choir, Chamber Orchestra, Piano Trio, String Quartet, Folk Song and Dance Ensemble, and Folk Instrument Orchestra all perform here. Ticket prices are reasonable and there are a lot of young people in the audience - these aren’t stuffy performances - anyone can go.

        <h3>
            A little more about Azerbaijan...
        </h3>
        <p>
            Azerbaijan, the nation and former Soviet republic, is bounded by the Caspian Sea and Caucasus Mountains, which span Asia and Europe. Its capital, Baku, is famed for its medieval walled Inner City. Within the Inner City lies the Palace of the Shirvanshahs, a royal retreat dating to the 15th century, and the centuries-old stone Maiden Tower, which dominates the city skyline. <br>
            
            Azerbaijan (/æzərbaɪˈdʒɑːn/ (About this soundlisten) AZ-ər-by-JAHN; Azerbaijani: Azərbaycan [ɑːzæɾbɑjˈd͡ʒɑn]), officially the Republic of Azerbaijan (Azerbaijani: Azərbaycan Respublikası [ɑːzæɾbɑjˈd͡ʒɑn ɾespublikɑˈsɯ]), is a landlocked country in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia at the crossroads of Eastern Europe and Western Asia.[7] It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south. The exclave of Nakhchivan is bound by Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, and has an 11 km long border with Turkey in the northwest.<br>

The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic proclaimed its independence in 1918 and became the first democratic Muslim state. In 1920 the country was incorporated into the Soviet Union as the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic.[8][9] The modern Republic of Azerbaijan proclaimed its independence on 30 August 1991,[10] shortly before the dissolution of the USSR in the same year. In September 1991, the Armenian majority of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region seceded to form the Republic of Artsakh.[11] The region and seven adjacent districts outside it became de facto independent with the end of the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1994. These regions are internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan pending a solution to the status of the Nagorno-Karabakh through negotiations facilitated by the OSCE.[12][13][14][15]<br>

Azerbaijan is a unitary semi-presidential republic.[2] It is a member state of the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and the NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) program. It is one of six independent Turkic states and an active member of the Turkic Council and the TÜRKSOY community. Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 158 countries and holds membership in 38 international organizations.[16] It is one of the founding members of GUAM, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)[17] and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. A member of the United Nations since 1992, Azerbaijan was elected to membership in the newly established Human Rights Council by the United Nations General Assembly on 9 May 2006. Its term of office began on 19 June 2006.[18] Azerbaijan is also a member state of the Non-Aligned Movement and holds observer status in the World Trade Organization.[16][19]<br>

While more than 89% of the population is Shia Muslim,[20] the Constitution of Azerbaijan does not declare an official religion and all major political forces in the country are secularist. Azerbaijan has a high level of human development that ranks on par with most Eastern European countries.[21] It has a high rate of economic development[22] and literacy,[23] as well as a low rate of unemployment.[24]
